    "# FRAUD DETECTION\n",

    "## Definition and various examples regarding FRAUD DETECTION.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial fraud is an ever growing menace with far consequences in the financial industry.Data science plays a crucial role in detecting frauds especially in the field of online transactions where we have many examples like the credit card frauds,online banking frauds etc. In this topic, today we will study about the credit card fraud detection as an example.\n",

    "## CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit card fraud detection, which is a data science problem, becomes challenging and interesting due to two major reasons regarding them - 1.First, the profiles of normal and fraudulent behaviours change constantly and 2.Secondly, credit card fraud data sets are highly changing in nature or twisting in nature. As credit card becomes the most general mode of payment (both online and regular purchase), fraud rate tends to accelerate. Detecting fraudulent transactions using traditional methods of manual detection are time consuming and inaccurate, thus the advent of big data had made these manual methods more impractical. However, financial institutions have turned to intelligent techniques. These intelligent fraud techniques comprise of computational intelligence (CI)-based techniques. Statistical fraud detection methods have been divided into two broad categories: supervised and unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us solve these problem using two methods called Naive Bayes,k-nearest neighbour classifier and Logistic Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Naive Bayes statistical approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on Bayesian theory, which chooses the decision based on highest probability. Bayesian probability estimates unknown probabilities from known values. It also allows prior knowledge and logic to be applied to uncertain statements. This technique has an assumption of conditional independence among features in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "                   P(ci | fk)=P(fk | ci)∗P(ci)P(fk)P(fk | ci)=∏i=1nP(fk|ci)k=1,…,n;i=1,2\n",
    "                   \n",
    "### k-Nearest Neighbour Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest neighbour is an instance based learning which carries out its classification based on a similarity measure, like Euclidean, Mahanttan or Minkowski distance functions. The first two distance measures work well with continuous variables while the third suits categorical variables. The Euclidean distance measure is used in this study for the kNN classifier. The Euclidean distance (Dij) between two input vectors (Xi, Xj) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    Dij=∑k=1n(Xik−Xjk)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−√   k=1,2,…,n\n",
    "                    \n",
    "### Logistic Regression Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression which uses a functional approach to estimate the probability of a binary response based on one or more variables (features). It finds the best-fit parameters to a nonlinear function called the sigmoid. The sigmoid function (σ) and the input (x) to the sigmoid function are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "                     σ(x)=1(1+ℓ−x)x=w0z0+w1z1+…+wnzn\n",
    "                     \n",
